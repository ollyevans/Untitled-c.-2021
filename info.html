          When you look at something small like a flower, and properly look at
          it, for a moment it is your world and you become completely immersed.
          I aim to photograph flowers in a way to let you experience them as I
          do.
          <br /><br />
          The ideas this project went through range from ideas such as the
          lifespan of a single flower, a flower deconstructed, hue shifted
          flowers, and varying arrangements. Different backdrops were considered
          and lighting arrangements but were disregarded as they drew away from
          the original experience.

          These photos were taken from a close distance, under natural light,
          with both manual and automatic focus. The photos have a wide aperture
          for a directed focus, a medium shutter to capture intricate details
          and ISO of 400 for rich blacks.
          <br />
          <br />
          The photos were shot and cropped to a square-format, intending to lead
          the viewer's eyes in a circle with a focus on central composition.
